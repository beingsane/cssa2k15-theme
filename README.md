###CSSA2k15

An updated, overhauled WordPress theme for uOttawa's CSSA (comp sci student's assoc.). Based off the awesome BlankSlate theme by TidyThemes.

#####Caveats, warnings, how to not break this theme

**BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR SITE'S MENUS.**

If the menu bar overflows, the whole site'll look like crap, and we can't have that. Be proactive about menu organization.

**Images will not display in the main index feed.**
This is to keep the blog minimal. At the same time, it passively forces authors to use the `Description` field while creating posts and pages so that the index isn't just a giant, horrifying wall of text.

**Use the descriptiong field or the `<!--more--> comment**

Keep it short -- when writing a long post, delimit what you want to show on the index using `<!--more-->` in the "Text" editing mode of a post.

e.g.

```
This is a post! It's super interesting, but kind of long!

<!--more-->

Aha! This part is very boring, and won't show up on the front page of the site.
```
